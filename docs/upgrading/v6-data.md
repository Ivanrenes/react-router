# Migrating to RouterProvider

When we originally began bringing the [Remix Data APIs over to React Router][remixing-react-router] we realized that they brought about a pretty different way of structuring your routes. Instead of discovering routes via the [`<Routes>`][routes-component] component _as React rendered the component tree_, we needed to _lift_ the route definitions so we could [decouple fetching from rendering][when-to-fetch].

This brought about an interesting conundrum. We've got tons of v6 [`BrowserRouter`][browserrouter] apps out there happily defining their routes via `<Routes>` components -- how can we provide them with a smooth upgrade experience that doesn't require a big-bang migration to the new approach? This ruled out a new major version and we focused on adding these new features in a _fully backwards compatible_ way that would provide users an _incremental_ upgrade path from [`BrowserRouter`][browserrouter] to [`RouterProvider`][routerprovider].

## Differences

The first thing to be aware of is the presence of a handful of new [Data APIs][data-apis] that only work on routes _defined_ via the new [data routers][picking-a-router] (i.e., `createBrowserRouter`). These include a few categories of APIs:

- Route-level data APIs such as `loader`, `action`, `shouldRevalidate`, `handle`, and `lazy`
- In-component data hooks such as `useLoaderData`, `useActionData`, `useFetcher`, `useMatches`, `useNavigation`, etc.
- Error-handling APIs such as `route.errorElement`, `route.ErrorBoundary`, and `useRouteError`

The rest of the APIs that existed prior to v6.4.0 are still usable in _both_ `BrowserRouter` and `RouterProvider` apps. These include common hooks/components such as `useNavigate`, `useLocation`, `useParams`, `<Link>`, `<Outlet />`, etc.

## Migrating

We built the new `<RouterProvider>` component such that it would enable the new Data APIs on routes defined at the root router, while not excluding descendant `<Routes>` trees so commonly used in `BrowserRouter` apps. This was explicitly to allow incremental migration from one to the other. Let's take a look at how we would do this.

### Current Application

Let's assume we've got a current application with 2 descendant route trees, and assume these routes are all doing in-component data fetching, and rendering their own loading and error states.

```jsx
import * as React from "react";
import {
  BrowserRouter,
  Link,
  Route,
  Routes,
} from "react-router-dom";

export default function App() {
  return (
    <BrowserRouter>
      <Routes>
        <Route path="/" element={<Home />} />
        <Route path="/blog/*" element={<BlogApp />} />
        <Route path="/users/*" element={<UserApp />} />
      </Routes>
    </BrowserRouter>
  );
}

function Home() {
  return (
    <>
      <h1>Welcome!</h1>
      <p>
        Check out the <Link to="/blog">blog</Link> or the{" "}
        <Link to="users">users</Link> section
      </p>
    </>
  );
}

function BlogApp() {
  return (
    <Routes>
      <Route index element={<h1>Blog Index</h1>} />
      <Route path="posts" element={<h1>Blog Posts</h1>} />
    </Routes>
  );
}

function UserApp() {
  return (
    <Routes>
      <Route index element={<h1>Users Index</h1>} />
    </Routes>
  );
}
```

### Add RouterProvider with a root splat route

We can render this application inside a `RouterProvider` with only a few small changes:

1. Change your current `App` component to `Root`
2. Remove the `<BrowserRouter>` component
3. Create a data router singleton with a splat route for the `Root` element
4. Add a new `App` component rendering a `<RouterProvider>`

```jsx lines=[10-13,15-18,20-21,22-23]
import * as React from "react";
import {
  createBrowserRouter,
  Link,
  Route,
  RouterProvider,
  Routes,
} from "react-router-dom";

// 3Ô∏è‚É£ Router singleton created
const router = createBrowserRouter([
  { path: "*", Component: Root },
]);

// 4Ô∏è‚É£ RouterProvider added
export default function App() {
  return <RouterProvider router={router} />;
}

// 1Ô∏è‚É£ Changed from App to Root
function Root() {
  // 2Ô∏è‚É£ `BrowserRouter` component removed, but the <Routes>/<Route>
  // component below are unchanged
  return (
    <Routes>
      <Route path="/" element={<Home />} />
      <Route path="/blog/*" element={<BlogApp />} />
      <Route path="/users/*" element={<UserApp />} />
    </Routes>
  );
}

function Home() {
  /* Unchanged */
}
function BlogApp() {
  /* Unchanged */
}
function UserApp() {
  /* Unchanged */
}
```

ü•≥ Congrats - you're now rendering a data router app! But wait a minute - we can't use any of the new stuff yet since none of our routes are defined at the top with `createBrowserRouter` üò¢. To access the new APIs, we need to start lifting routes one-by-one to the data router.

### Start lifting routes and leveraging the data APIs

Let's start with the `/` route for the `<Home>` component. All we need to do is lift the `<Route>` definition up to the data router:

```jsx lines=[2,13]
const router = createBrowserRouter([
  { path: "/", Component: Home }, // üÜï
  { path: "*", Component: Root },
]);

export default function App() {
  return <RouterProvider router={router} />;
}

function Root() {
  return (
    <Routes>
      {/* ‚¨ÜÔ∏è Home route lifted up to the data router */}
      <Route path="/blog/*" element={<BlogApp />} />
      <Route path="/users/*" element={<UserApp />} />
    </Routes>
  );
}
```

Now you can add data APIs to your home route (`loader`, `action`, `errorElement`) and start leveraging data hooks inside your Home component (`useLoaderData`, `useActionData`, `useFetcher`, `<Form>`, etc.).

Now let's look at lifting the Blog App upwards, but still doing it one leaf route at a time. In order to lift the `/blog` index route up, we need the `/blog/*` splat route lifted as well, but we can still render the `/blog/posts` route where it is and do that separately.

```jsx lines=[3-12,23,32]
const router = createBrowserRouter([
  { path: "/", Component: Home },
  {
    // Lifted blog splat route
    path: "/blog/*",
    children: [
      // New blog index route
      { index: true, Component: () => <h1>Blog Index</h1> },
      // Blog subapp splat route added for /blog/posts matching
      { path: "*", Component: BlogApp },
    ],
  },
  { path: "*", Component: Root },
]);

export default function App() {
  return <RouterProvider router={router} />;
}

function Root() {
  return (
    <Routes>
      {/* ‚¨ÜÔ∏è Blog splat route lifted */}
      <Route path="/users/*" element={<UserApp />} />
    </Routes>
  );
}

function BlogApp() {
  return (
    <Routes>
      {/* ‚¨ÜÔ∏è Blog index route lifted */}
      <Route path="posts" element={<h1>Blog Posts</h1>} />
    </Routes>
  );
}
```

And now your blog index route can participate in data loading.

You can keep doing this one route at a time until you've eventually converted all of your routes to data routes and can no longer use any nested `<Routes>` to define your routing tree. To avoid bundle bloat, it's recommended to leverage the [route.lazy][route-lazy] prop to lazily load your routes.
